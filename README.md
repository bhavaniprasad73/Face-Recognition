# Face-Recognition
Facial Recognition
1. Select the file FaceRecognition.m to run the program
2. The database of images are stored in the subfolder s1 in att_faces folder and the program will read the image from the s1.
3. Enter  the input quaery face image that want to be recognize by giving number [1- 400 ] for variable 'L'
4. To get output face image it takes sometime inorder to compute the eigen faces and weights for the all the training face images.


Note:
If incase, code shows any variable errors once clear the workspace. I have face problem once with variable unchange value, So I have cleared the workspace then it runs fine.
